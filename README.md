## dotfiles
Personal Dotfiles with an added install script.

### Stack

- **Awesome** as the WM
- **Kitty** as the terminal emulator
- **NeoVim** as the texteditor
- **Rofi** a dmenu-like window switcher and application launcher
- **Starship** prompt
- **zsh** as the shell

### install.sh
Ideally suited to run on a bare bones Arch install. Should work on most GNU / Linux distros.
