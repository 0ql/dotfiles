## dotfiles
Personal Dotfiles with an added install script.

### Stack

- **Hyprland** as the WM
- **Kitty** as the terminal emulator
- **NeoVim** as the texteditor
- **Wofi** a dmenu/rofi-like window switcher and application launcher
- **Starship** prompt
- **zsh** as the shell

### install.sh
Ideally suited to run on a bare bones Arch install. Should work on most GNU / Linux distros.

To clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0ql/dotfiles
```
